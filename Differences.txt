# Differences from the main Kirby series

The scenario, events, and character portrayals in Kirby: Right Back at Ya! differ greatly from the main video game series, and as such, are considered to be separate continuities. The following list goes over the more notable differences between the anime and the video games up to that point, though there are many more smaller differences that are not mentioned here:

- Portrayals of characters common to both series differ in various respects:
    - Kirby is portrayed as more helpless and immature, requiring proper direction in order to defeat his foes and help his friends. Inversely, he is portrayed as much more powerful than his video game counterpart, particularly when using Copy Abilities.
    - King Dedede is portrayed as much more villainous, haughty, and ignorant. While his characterization is true to how he was depicted in early games, by the     time of Kirby 64: The Crystal Shards, he is most often depicted as a well-intentioned friendly rival, with their conflicts usually coming as a result of            outside influence or a misunderstanding. In the anime, his intense jealousy of Kirby and his selfishness lead him to be the source of most of the problems in       the show, and causes everyone else to despise him to varying degrees.
    - Meta Knight is portrayed as unambiguously heroic and a mentor to Kirby. In games prior to his appearance in the anime, he was often seen as a mysterious      character with unclear motives, sometimes aiding Kirby and sometimes antagonizing him. In later games, he would become an ally to Kirby, however he often           still has his own motives and sees Kirby as more of a sparring partner to train with.
    - Several other characters from the video games, such as common enemies, Mid-Bosses, and Bosses, are portrayed differently to varying degrees in the anime,     with some having their appearances modified, some having different abilities, and some having different characterizations which make them not necessarily           hostile to Kirby. Some notable examples of these are the depictions of the Cappies, Knuckle Joe, Lololo & Lalala, Chef Kawasaki, and Sword Knight & Blade           Knight.
- Dream Land itself is portrayed much more realistically when compared to its video game counterpart, having less fantastical terrain (particularly the lack of cloud and energy-based structures).
    - Castle Dedede in particular is much larger and has a different shape than its main video game series counterpart (though it should be noted that the anime          design was used in some later games).
    - Cappy Town is unique to the anime series, with no equivalent in the games.
- The main recurring characters Tiff, Tuff, Escargoon, the N.M.E. Sales Guy, Tokkori, Doctor Yabui, and the named Cappies, among others, are exclusive to the anime (barring a few cameo appearances).
- Several of the monsters and guest characters that feature in the anime are exclusive to it.
- Night Mare Enterprises and the Star Warriors are exclusive to the anime.
- The Warp Star does not function the same way in the anime as it does in the games.
