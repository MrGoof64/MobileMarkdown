# *Kirby: Right Back at Ya!*

*_Kirby: Right Back at Ya!_* is an anime television program which is based on the Kirby series. 
It was produced jointly by Nintendo and HAL Laboratory through a subsidiary company called 
"Warpstar, Inc." and was directed by S≈çji Yoshikawa and Mitsuo Kusakabe, with supervision 
and the original draft coming from Masahiro Sakurai.[1] The show originally aired on October 
6, 2001 in Japan through CBC Broadcasting and consisted of one hundred episodes aired in 
the morning on a weekly basis, concluding on September 27, 2003. The show would later be 
dubbed into English by 4Kids Entertainment, and aired on Fox Box from September 14, 2002 
to December 9, 2006 with intermittent pauses and changes in episode ordering. An HD remaster
of the show on Blu-ray was released in Japan on March 14, 2023.

The show follows Kirby, taking the role of a space-faring hero who has a child-like demeanor 
and is incapable of regular speech. He crashes his starship into the kingdom of Dream Land, 
where he stays in order to battle monsters summoned by the land's greedy and tyrannical King 
Dedede from the evil intergalactic corporation Night Mare Enterprises. Over the course of 
the show, Kirby gradually becomes stronger and more experienced - aided by his close friends 
Tiff, Tuff, and Meta Knight - while consistently foiling the plans of King Dedede, his assistant 
Escargoon, and the main villain eNeMeE, who has largely conquered the universe and is trying 
to destroy the remaining Star Warriors who oppose him. Eventually, Kirby and his allies launch 
an attack on eNeMeE's space fortress in the final episode, thus putting an end to Night Mare 
Enterprises, liberating the universe, and depriving King Dedede of his main means of harassing 
his subjects.
